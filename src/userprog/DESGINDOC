We don't have any new structs for stack setup. We followed the regarding stack setup
hints/instrurctions. 

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do

>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

I tokenize the command line by spaces using strtok_r, store pointers in argv[], 
and then push the arguments onto the user stack in reverse order so they appear 
in the correct order when accessed. I align the stack to 4 bytes, add a null sentinel, 
then push the argv pointers, argc, and a fake return address. To avoid overflow, 
I build everything within a single zeroed stack page and check that each push stays
within the page boundary.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?
 Pintos uses strtok_r() because it is re entry and thread-safe, 
 meaning it can safely parse strings in multiple threads without interfering 
 with each other. The regular strtok() uses static internal state, 
 which would break in a multi-threaded kernel like Pintos.



>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this

 The Unix approach is better because (1) it keeps the kernel simpler and smaller, 
 leaving command parsing to user programs, and (2) it allows different shells or 
 interpreters to implement their own parsing rules or features without changing the kernel.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

They are only unique within a single process. If process A has the fd 3, process B 
can also have the fd 3. However, it is important they are unique within processes. 
Every open file has a file descriptor that lives inside the file descriptor table. In 
our case, these are structs.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

I use small, safe primitives to cross the user/kernel boundary. 
For reading from user → kernel, I call copy_bytes(), which loops with get_user() 
byte-by-byte; on any invalid user address (get_user returns -1) I terminate the process 
(exit(-1)). For writing kernel → user (e.g., read to a user buffer), 
I use put_user(uint8_t *udst, uint8_t byte) inside a loop; if a single byte can’t be 
written, I clean up and exit(-1). For files, read()/write() translate the fd to a struct
 file_descriptor*, operate on fd->file_ref under file_lock, and move data in chunks via 
 a kernel page (to avoid touching user memory in the filesys layer). 
 I special-case STDIN (character by character via input_getc) and STDOUT (via putbuf),
  validate all user pointers (and lengths) up front, and align/limit copies to stay within mapped memory.

Copying a full 4 KB page byte-by-byte could call pagedir_get_page() up to 4096 times 
(once per byte), though only 1 time is really needed if the page is cached or translated 
once.
Copying just 2 bytes could require 2 lookups in the worst case (crossing a page boundary)
 or 1 lookup normally.
We could reduce this to one lookup per page by checking the mapping once per 4 KB region, 
greatly improving efficiency.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

wait(pid) finds the child’s child_process struct, then calls 
sema_down(&cp->sema_wait) to block the parent until the child calls exit(), 
which performs sema_up.  When the child terminates, the parent collects its exitcode, 
removes the child from its list, and returns the code—ensuring proper synchronization 
and no zombie processes.

We centralize pointer validation and cleanup instead of scattering checks everywhere. 
For every user-space access, we use helper functions like copy_bytes(), get_user(), 
and user_to_kernel_vaddr() that safely copy data and automatically call exit(-1) 
if an invalid address is detected. This keeps the main syscall logic clean—system calls 
can assume arguments are valid once copied.

For cleanup, we use a structured approach: locks are always released immediately before 
returning or on any error path, and temporary buffers (like pages from palloc_get_page())
are freed right after use. For example, in read(), I acquire file_lock, allocate a kernel 
page, and ensure both are released and freed even if put_user() fails mid-copy. 
This way, error handling is consistent and doesn’t clutter the main logic.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

When a parent calls exec(), it creates a child_process struct with a 
semaphore (sema_initialization). The parent calls sema_down() right after thread_create(),
blocking until the child finishes loading in start_process(). The child sets a flag 
(load_success = true/false) and then calls sema_up() to wake the parent. The parent 
checks cp->load_success; if it’s false, it returns -1. This ensures the parent never 
returns before loading completes and knows if it failed.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

Each child has its own child_process struct shared with the parent. 
When the parent calls wait(C) before C exits, it blocks on cp->sema_wait 
until the child calls exit() and signals with sema_up(). If the child exits 
first, has_exited is already true, so the parent immediately returns the 
stored exitcode. After waiting, the parent removes and frees the child_process 
struct. If the parent exits first, it frees all its children’s metadata so they 
can clean up on their own. This avoids races and prevents double-freeing.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

We used helper functions (get_user, put_user, copy_bytes, user_to_kernel_vaddr) 
to safely handle user memory because they isolate error checking and simplify 
syscall code. This makes every memory access consistent and ensures invalid 
pointers immediately terminate the process without cluttering core logic.


>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

My file descriptor design uses a per-thread list of file_descriptor structs, 
each mapping an id to a struct file *. This is simple, easy to manage, 
and allows independent file tables per process. The main disadvantage is 
lookup overhead (linear search) and extra memory use per descriptor.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

I kept the tid_t → pid_t mapping as identity because it’s simple and 
sufficient for single-threaded processes.
